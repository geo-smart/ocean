    "- Ingest low-time-resolution data from the THREDDS server\n",
    "    - 1 sample per minute\n",
    "    - 17 data files in NetCDF format, 23 sensors\n",
    "    - Select a time window (e.g. one month: Jan 2022)\n",
    "    - Write to results as NetCDF files to a local (in-repo) data folder\n",
    "- Check the data for expected profiler behavior based on the `z` depth data variable\n",
