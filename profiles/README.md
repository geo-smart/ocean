The 'older' folder is an earlier format for profile calculations. It has to its credit an attempt at profile
data spanning start of operations in 2014 through some of 2021. The format needs verification but from my
recollection the rows are:

a0-index a0-time a1-index a1-time d0-index d0-time d1-index d1-time r0-index r0-time r1-index r1-time
